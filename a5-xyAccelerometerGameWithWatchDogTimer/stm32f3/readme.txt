This project is a simple monitor program for the STM32F303VCT6 on the
STM32F3 Discovery board.  This processor has 256K of flash, and 48K of
RAM. The Discovery board has 10 LEDs, a 3 axis Gyroscope, 3 axis
accelerometer, and a 3 axis magnetic sensor.

The Simple monitor program provides a command line parser, with
facilities for the user to add new commands on a module by module
basis.  The parser is capable of recognizing one word commands, and
calling a function that implements that command.  The function may
then retrieve additional arguments from the command line, and act
accordingly.  Online brief help is provided automatically, extended
help is available optionally on a command by command basis.

The structure of the simple monitor program is one of a
foreground/background system.  The main loop of the program
initializes all the peripherals, enables interrupts, sets up I/O
conditions, and then calls a series of 'Tasks' in sequence.  The user
can extend this by adding their own background tasks to the main loop.
Caution should be exercised by the user to ensure that every task
returns back to the main loop if there is no work to do. Any task that
blocks waiting for an I/O event to occur will stall the whole
system. (For example, calling the delay() function inside your task is
frowned upon, use a timer or virtual timer instead.)

Note: There are multiple STM32F3Discovery board versions out there.
The Rev B. boards come preloaded with STLINK-V2, whereas the Rev
C. boards have STLINK-V2-1.  OpenOCD cannot automatically determine
the difference.  This means that in the Makefile, if you have a Rev
B. board, you will have to uncomment the relevant lines before being
able to program it.  The default is Rev C now.
